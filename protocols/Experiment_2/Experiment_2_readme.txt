The backscatter data can be found in the excel file "40_20230717_Kai_mutants_and_friends.xlsx". In this experiment the biomass (backscatter) was measured at 730 nm and gain 6. Additionally, the eYFP flourescence was measured at gain 4.
The data for each channel contain calibrated and raw values for each well of which only the raw data were considered for the analysis.
The protocol for the BioLection software and the LAM-tool can be found in this folder as a JSON-file and LUA-file respectively.
The experiment ran for a total of ~165 h. After 84 h a dark pulse of 24 h was given. Afterwards, the cultures were incubated in continous light.
For the analysis shown in the publication, only the first 84 h of the experiment were considered.
